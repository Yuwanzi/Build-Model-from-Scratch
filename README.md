# Build Basic Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

While there are plenty of great built-in model libraries, I find it very useful to code basic model algorithms from scratch. It will help you gain a much deeper understanding of what's inside those commonly-used supervised and unsupervised learning tools. 

From now on, I will add python codes for the following algorithms 
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - Neural Networks
 - K-nearest Neighbour Regression & Classification
 - Anomaly detection
 - Principle Component Analysis

This work is heavily inspired by the materials and notes from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

The dependencies include:
 - [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
 - [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
 
Please feel free to email me if have any comments/suggestions.
