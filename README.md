# Build Basic Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

While there are plenty of great built-in model libraries, I find it very useful to code basic model algorithms from scratch. It will help you gain a much deeper understanding of what's inside those commonly-used supervised and unsupervised learning tools. 

From now on, I will gradually add python codes for the following algorithms 
 - Linear Regression (Completed)
 - Logistic Regression (Completed)
 - Neural Networks (by 2015/10/16)
 - K-nearest Neighbour Regression & Classification (by 2015 10/23)
 - Anomaly detection (by 2015/10/30)
 - Principle Component Analysis (by 2015/11/5)

This work is heavily inspired by the materials and notes from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

The dependencies include:
 - [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
 - [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
 
Please feel free to email me if you have any comments/suggestions.
