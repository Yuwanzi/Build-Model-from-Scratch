# Build Basic Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

**Please note that the equations are not rendered properly with Firefox in Linux. Please use Chrome to view all the Jupyter/Ipython notebooks. This is an known issue mentioned [here](https://github.com/jupyter/nbviewer/issues/452), and I will keep posted if any update is available.**


While there are plenty of great built-in model libraries, I find it very useful to code basic model algorithms from scratch. It will help you gain a much deeper understanding of what's inside those commonly-used supervised and unsupervised learning tools. 

From now on, I will gradually add python codes for the following algorithms 
 - Linear Regression (Completed)
 - Logistic Regression (Completed)
 - Neural Networks (Completed)
 - K-nearest Neighbour Regression & Classification (Completed)
 - Anomaly detection (Completed)
 - Principle Component Analysis (Completed)
 - Anything else? (TBD, such as K-Means, Decision Tree, and collaborative filterting?)

This work is partially inspired by the materials and notes from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

The dependencies include:
 - [numpy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html)
 - [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
 
Please feel free to email me if you have any comments/suggestions.
